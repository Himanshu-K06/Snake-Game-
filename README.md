# Snake-Game-

## Overview

A fully functional retro-style Snake Game built using Python and Pygame.
This project demonstrates understanding of game loops, event handling, collision detection, rendering graphics, and state management in a real-time environment. Developed as an introduction to game development concepts and object-oriented programming in Python.

## Features

- Grid-based snake movement using vector mechanics
- Smooth real-time gameplay using Pygame event loop
- Food spawning with collision prevention logic
- Snake growth on eating food
- Boundary and self-collision detection
- Game reset with state management
- Score tracking
- Minimalistic retro UI with custom board boundary and title


## Tech Stack

Language: Python
Library: Pygame
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming


## Practical understanding of:

Game loops
Rendering graphics
Keyboard input handling
Collision logic
State and score management


## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to control the snake
- Eat food to grow
- Avoid hitting the walls or yourself
- Press any key to restart after game over
